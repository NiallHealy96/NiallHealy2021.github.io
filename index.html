				In 2018 Mental Health Ireland surveyed a sample of the Irish population asking their own attitudes towards mental health and recovery. We found:
				</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
                     <li>On average, women have a lower wellbeing score than men</li>
                     <li>Those who are younger, on average, scored lower on the wellbeing scale than those who are older</li>
                     <li>On average, those who are unemployed and those who are full-time homemakers have a lower score than those who are in full-time or part-time employment</li>
					 <li>Higher positive mental health is more likely among men than women and among 15-24 year olds than those over 25 years.</li>
					 <li>The majority of people (93%) reported that there are things we can do to improve our mental health and wellbeing.</li>
                    </ul>  
				</p>
				<p>
				Some 18.5 per cent of the Irish population was recorded as having a mental health disorder, such as anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, depression, or alcohol or drug use, in 2016.
                Rates of depression were also well above the European average for both men and women in Ireland. However, the suicide rate here was below average.
				Some 28 per cent of Irish children aged between 11 and 15 years reported being bullied in school, while 14 per cent were cyberbullied. These figures were close to the EU average.
